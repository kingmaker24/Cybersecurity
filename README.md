## Introduction

This repository presents an implementation of augmented reality steganography, a novel technique for hiding secret messages within augmented reality (AR) images or scenes. Augmented reality steganography combines the principles of steganography with AR technology to embed hidden data seamlessly into AR content.

## Features

- Encode secret messages into AR images or scenes
- Decode hidden messages from AR images or scenes
- Support for various encoding and decoding techniques
- Integration with popular AR frameworks and libraries
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Usage

To encode a message into an AR image or scene:

```python
from ar_steganography import ARSteganography

message = "This is a secret message"
ar_image = ARSteganography.encode(message)
print("Encoded AR image:", ar_image)
```

To decode a message from an AR image or scene:

```python
from ar_steganography import ARSteganography

ar_image = "encoded_ar_image.png"
message = ARSteganography.decode(ar_image)
print("Decoded message:", message)
```

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```
pip install ar-steganography
```
